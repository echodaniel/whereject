Google Apps script written in Javascript to filter emails and send to ticketing system.

Once completed, this will let you apply a label to your emails and have the script automatically run every ten minutes. Then, based on whatever filter you have applied to this label, the script will then forward the emails wherever you like. However, my Javascript is rusty.
